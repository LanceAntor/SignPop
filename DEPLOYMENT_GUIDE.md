# SignPop - Streamlit Deployment Guide

## ✅ What Was Fixed

Your original Flask app had dependency issues that prevented Streamlit Cloud deployment. Here's what was fixed:

### 1. **Requirements.txt Issues Fixed:**
- ❌ **Removed:** `tensorflow-intel` (Intel-specific, not available on cloud)
- ❌ **Removed:** `opencv-contrib-python` (conflicts in cloud environments) 
- ❌ **Removed:** `sounddevice` (not supported in Streamlit Cloud)
- ❌ **Removed:** Many unnecessary Flask dependencies
- ✅ **Added:** `streamlit` for the web framework
- ✅ **Changed:** to `opencv-python-headless` for cloud compatibility
- ✅ **Streamlined:** all version constraints for compatibility

### 2. **New Files Created:**
- `streamlit_app.py` - Main Streamlit application
- `.streamlit/config.toml` - Streamlit configuration
- `test_setup.py` - Dependency testing script
- Updated `README.md` with deployment instructions

## 🚀 How to Deploy

### Option 1: Streamlit Cloud (Recommended)
1. **Push to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Convert to Streamlit app"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy on Streamlit Cloud:**
   - Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)
   - Click "New app"
   - Connect your GitHub repo
   - Set main file: `streamlit_app.py`
   - Click "Deploy"

### Option 2: Local Testing
1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Test setup:**
   ```bash
   python test_setup.py
   ```

3. **Run Streamlit app:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run streamlit_app.py
   ```

## 📋 What's Different in Streamlit Version

### ✅ **What Works:**
- 🏠 Home page with game overview
- 📚 Tutorial with ASL alphabet images
- 🎯 Game mechanics (falling letters, scoring)
- 📊 Real-time stats and navigation
- 🎮 Game controls (start/stop/reset)

### 🔄 **What Needs Camera Integration:**
For full camera functionality in Streamlit, you'll need to:

1. **Use Streamlit Camera Input:**
   ```python
   camera_input = st.camera_input("Take a picture")
   ```

2. **Or integrate with streamlit-webrtc:**
   ```bash
   pip install streamlit-webrtc
   ```

3. **Or deploy with custom WebRTC solution**

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Deploy basic version** using the current `streamlit_app.py`
2. **Add camera integration** using streamlit-webrtc or camera_input
3. **Test on Streamlit Cloud** to ensure everything works
4. **Enhance UI** with additional Streamlit components

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### If deployment fails:
1. Check that all files are committed to GitHub
2. Verify `streamlit_app.py` is in the root directory
3. Ensure `requirements.txt` matches the fixed version
4. Check Streamlit Cloud logs for specific errors

### Common issues:
- **"Package not found":** Usually means a package in requirements.txt isn't available
- **"Import error":** Check that all local files (like `hand_detector.py`) are included
- **"Model not found":** Ensure `Model/` folder with `.h5` and `.txt` files is included

## 🎉 Success!

Your SignPop app should now deploy successfully on Streamlit Cloud with the fixed requirements.txt and new Streamlit interface!
